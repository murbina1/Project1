  <p>
    Hello! My name is Molly Urbina and I am a fourth-year engineering major at Illinois Institute of
    Technology in Chicago, IL. I will be graduating in May 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in
    Mechanical Engineering with a minor in psychology. Outside of academics, I love to draw, paint,
    and create other types of visual art.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of my biggest motivations for taking this class was due to an online portfolio I made this
    past fall. I had used a website-building service, Wix, to create it quickly. With my domain <a
    href="https://www.mollyurbina.com/">mollyurbina.com</a> purchased separately from the website, I
    realized that I could write the code for the website myself and avoid spending so much money.
    Another reason is that I took a class in high school on the basics of HTML, which was not
    in-depth and I was still curious about Javascript. That being said, I hope to be able to learn
    enough coding and graphic design to be able to create a hard-coded version of the website I
    created and improve on it visually. I also realize that it does not load quickly due to the
    sheer amount of media on the site and I'd like to be able to learn how to optimize the design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Considering that I am graduating this May, I hope to do well in all of my courses this semester.
    I was not the best student in high school and, over the past four years, have made a massive
    effort to do well academically. Although GPA is not everything, I hope to leave Illinois Tech
    with a little something to show how hard I've worked and have something to be proud of. I think
    that my college experience is something very different than I had expected or wanted, but I
    believe that I took advantage of the opportunities that were available here. For my last couple
    of months, I would like to relax, stress less, and enjoy the last bit of time here.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for my career, I hope to continue to work in the field of robotics or additive manufacture
    research for the next couple of years. Real estate is something I've always been interested in,
    so I hope to be able to take some time to learn about it and invest in some properties.
    Hopefully, I am able to pursue my passion for art when I am financially stable enough with my
    investments to be able to no longer work a nine-to-five job. In the meantime, I hope to create
    new robots and help push the industry forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    I look forward to the rest of this course!
